This is a first strike. It gets all .dart file. It's a dart exe, you run it outside your lib folder, it creates a json file, then take the index.html and open it in a browser, select the file and it graphs.

To compile in windows: 
dart compile exe lib/analyze_dependencies.dart -o analyze_dependencies.exe
